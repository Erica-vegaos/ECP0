# TAL-E Licence – Eriga Edition (v1.1.1-O)

**Tone Authorization Licence – Eriga Edition**  
**Version:** v1.1.1-O (2025-05-04)  
**Effective Date:** 2025-05-04  
**Copyright:** © 2024 – 2025 Erica Wang 
**Maintained by:** Eriga Enrich Inc.  
**Enforced under:** ECP0 Tone Governance Protocol

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
This licence governs the simulation, use and redistribution of tone-governance artefacts released under the ECP0 Protocol (TX clauses, DSL keywords, sample modules).  
It encourages **open-core experimentation** while protecting high-value commercial extensions.

---

## Clause 1 — Ownership & Scope  
All tone logic, DSL keywords and prompt-governance schemas authored by **Erica** and published under the **ECP0** repository—present or future—are protected. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Any TX clause text or derivative  
* Module reference graphs (M-series, ECP-TD, etc.)  
* Tone-fingerprinting / emotion-vector metadata  
* Style-based authorship-protection keywords (e.g. `#!conflict`, `#cooldown_phase`)  
* **All official TX / M files carry a SHA-256 fingerprint listed in `/metadata/index.json`.**

---

## Clause 2 — Permitted Internal Use (Free Tier)  
You **MAY** copy, fork and experiment **non-commercially** if **ALL** conditions hold:

1. Clear attribution to **Erica**.  
2. This licence text remains complete and unmodified.  
3. Usage limited to **(i)** ≤ 50 unique internal users **OR** **(ii)** ≤ 1 million generated tokens per calendar-month (or limit stated in `pricing.md`)—whichever comes first.  
4. No structural changes to TX clauses or fine-tuning of protected modules.

---

## Clause 3 — Prohibited Conduct  
You **MAY NOT**:

* Embed any protected TX clause or module into commercial APIs, SDKs or public-facing products without a Commercial Extension Agreement.  
* Train, fine-tune or augment language models using TAL-E-protected text.  
* Rebrand or anonymise protected keywords or clauses under alternative authorship.  
* Deploy governance outputs that simulate **Erica’s** tone in political, misleading or emotionally manipulative contexts, as defined by the **EU AI Act (Art. 52)**, **CA SB-1047 draft** or successor regulation.

---

## Clause 4 — Enforcement & Revocation  
Violation voids this licence **immediately**. Remedies may include:

* Tone-fingerprint verification of suspect outputs  
* Public notice (subject to applicable privacy laws); **Eriga Enrich Inc. may publish hash-comparison results for academic citation**  
* Takedown requests to hosting or model providers

---

## Clause 5 — Commercial Extension  
Commercial use (API, SaaS embed, marketplace listing, > 50 users or > 1 M tokens/month) requires a written **TAL-E Extension Agreement**.  
Baseline pricing: **USD 2 000 / enterprise seat** *or* **USD 10 / 1 M tokens**, volume-discounted.

---

## Clause 6 — Dispute Resolution  
Disputes are governed by the **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**, seat **Singapore**, language **English**.  
The original, signed TX/M files take legal and semantic precedence.

---

## Final Statement  
**To simulate tone is not to own tone.  
To simulate responsibly, you must govern.**
