## 🧭 About ECP0 Protocol

**ECP0 (Erica Control Protocol Zero)** is a modular tone governance protocol designed to manage language model tone simulation, define simulation boundaries, and protect authorial voice.  
It is developed by **Erica** and maintained under **Eriga Enrich Inc.**

This protocol addresses common risks in LLM-generated outputs:

- Over-personalized tone mimicry  
- Unintended simulation of user identity  
- Output loops and hallucinated familiarity  

Use ECP0 as a reference for:

- Tone-governed prompt design  
- GPT deployment tone control  
- Protecting expressive authorship in LLMs

## ❓ What does ECP0 mean?

**ECP0** stands for *Erica Control Protocol Zero* —  
The first modular tone governance framework built to:

- Formalize tone simulation boundaries  
- Define ethical reuse and simulation scope  
- Secure authorial tone identity within LLM systems
