About ECP0 Protocol
ECP0 (Erica Control Protocol 0) is a modular tone governance protocol designed to manage language model output tone, simulation boundaries, and authorial voice protection. It is developed by Erica and maintained under Eriga Enrich Inc.

It addresses common governance risks in LLM-generated content such as:

Over-personalized tone mimicry

Unintended simulation of user identity

Output loops and hallucinated familiarity

Use it as a reference for tone-governed prompt design, GPT deployment governance, or protecting your authored tone in language model outputs.

What does ECP0 mean?
ECP0 stands for Erica Control Protocol Zero — the first modular tone governance framework designed to formalize tone simulation boundaries, define ethical reuse, and secure authorship alignment within LLM systems.
