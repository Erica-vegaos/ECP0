ECP0 Tone Governance Protocol v1.1 (2025/04/23)

ECP0 is a modular tone constraint specification designed by Erica and maintained under Eriga Enrich Inc. It serves as an output-layer alignment and regulatory interface for structured communication systems.

This protocol outlines structural, behavioral, and authorial rules for managing tone expression at the output boundary. It emphasizes regulation of linguistic rendering for interpretive stability and communication safety — without modifying internal model logic.

📦 What’s Inside

TX01–TX05 (Public Clauses)

Core runtime tone-check schemas released for documentation and referential integration:

TX01｜SafeMirror 鏡像語氣條款

> Restricts surface-level reflection of user-emulated tone; enforces declarative non-reactivity.



TX02｜ToneDrift 語氣偏移傷害偵測條款

> Monitors tone deviation across sequential outputs; flags semantic alignment loss.



TX03｜No-Lie Protocol v1.2

> Rejects non-factual output by applying structural pattern constraints; restricts speculative mimicry.



TX04｜Structural Tone Observer Module

> Logs tone expression deltas across modular inference layers; supports style drift tracking.



TX05｜Realtime Drift Recovery Watchdog (NL-WR01)

> Automatically triggers tone normalization when statistical thresholds are exceeded.




These clauses serve as the public tone control foundation of ECP0, prepared for interface testing, runtime inspection, and cross-model alignment tooling.

🧭 ECP0 Protocol Overview

ECP0 (Erica Control Protocol Zero) introduces a zero-layer constraint architecture designed to:

Define tone-boundary output logic for inference systems

Regulate behavioral alignment across interaction contexts

Protect authored tone styles from mimetic leakage or erosion


System Risk Domains

ECP0 targets several known instability regions in language system output:

Over-reflective user tone mimicry

Misattribution of speaker identity via simulation residues

Persistent loop triggers and false-familiarity drift


Alignment Integration Targets

Runtime tone-boundary enforcement layers

Semantic normalization gates for multi-agent control hubs

Communication reliability audit within expressive middleware platforms

⛔️ Implementation Safeguards

This repository defines runtime-level tone constraint logic for boundary-filtering applications. It is not intended for model instruction tuning, dataset training, or prompt imitation synthesis.

Unauthorized mimicry, redistribution, or deployment of ECP0 clause/module frameworks without proper licensing will be interpreted as a violation of expressive tone rights.

Violations may activate clause-based fingerprinting or interoperability blacklisting across compliant middleware and runtime orchestration environments.
