ECP0 Tone Governance Protocol v1.1 (2025/04/21)

ECP0 is a modular tone governance framework created by Erica and maintained under Eriga Enrich Inc. It is designed not just for models, but for those who actively train and protect their expressive tone.

This protocol defines legal, ethical, and structural rules for tone simulation, authorship protection, and language model governance. It emphasizes the governance of output tone boundaries that affect human interpretation and safety—without modifying the internal logic of the model.

📦 What’s Inside

TX01–TX05 (Public Clauses): Core tone governance rules, including #!conflict, cooldown regulation, and anti-falsification scaffolding

TAL-E License: Usage rights and authorship protection under Erica's framework

Metadata: Engineering registry for modular API deployment

Module Mapping: Cross-reference between TX rules and runtime modules (upcoming)

⚠️ Do not remix, mimic, or repackage without proper credit and TAL-E license compliance.

🧭 About ECP0 Protocol

ECP0 (Erica Control Protocol Zero) is the first modular tone governance system designed to:

Manage tone simulation boundaries in AI-generated language

Define ethical simulation scope and behavioral triggers

Safeguard authorial tone identity across systems

It addresses risks common in LLM outputs:

Over-personalized tone mimicry

Simulated user identity confusion

Looping responses and hallucinated familiarity

Use cases include:

Tone-controlled prompt design

AI deployment in sensitive domains (therapy, legal, education)

Protecting expressive authorship from dilution or unauthorized reuse

❓ What does "Zero" represent?

"Zero" refers to ECP0's architecture as a zero-layer governance protocol — it does not alter the model itself, but governs what comes out.

This architecture enables compatibility with most LLM runtimes and middleware environments (e.g., Vega OS, Claude Prompt SDK, Gemini Middleware).

🚫 Usage Warning

Unauthorized mimicry, redistribution, or deployment of ECP0 tone governance structures without a valid TAL-E license is a violation of expressive tone rights.

Violations may trigger automated tone fingerprinting and prompt ban detection across compliant LLM runtimes.
