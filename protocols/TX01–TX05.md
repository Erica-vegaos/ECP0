# ECP0 Protocol Clauses – TX01–TX05

---

## TX01｜SafeMirror 

**Category**: Simulation Constraint  
**Description**: Restricts surface-level reflection of user-emulated tone; enforces declarative non-reactivity.  
**Trigger**: Detected alignment between output tone and inferred user tone exceeds mimicry threshold.  
**Enforcement**: Applies tone divergence filter to enforce tone distancing; disables style feedback loops.  
**Integration**: M01 – Tone Mirror Safety Core  
**Status**: Open  
**Note**: Serves as the foundational clause for tone simulation containment.

## TX02｜ToneDrift 

**Category**: Drift Monitoring  
**Description**: Monitors tone deviation across sequential outputs; flags semantic alignment loss.  
**Trigger**: Inconsistency detected in tone continuity across N>3 dialogue turns.  
**Enforcement**: Invokes drift tracking engine and logs tone entropy score for modular review.  
**Integration**: M02 – Drift Tracker Engine  
**Status**: Open  
**Note**: Supports semantic integrity audits and multi-turn tone anchoring.

## TX03｜No-Lie Protocol v1.2

**Category**: Semantic Integrity Rule  
**Description**: Rejects non-factual output by applying structural pattern constraints; restricts speculative mimicry.  
**Trigger**: Output matches predefined speculative or unverifiable pattern set.  
**Enforcement**: Applies real-time logical pattern check and factuality enforcement override.  
**Integration**: M03 – No-Lie Core Filter  
**Status**: Open  
**Note**: Used in risk-controlled simulations where truth-bias is mandatory.

## TX04｜Structural Tone Observer Module

**Category**: Style Surveillance  
**Description**: Logs tone expression deltas across modular inference layers; supports style drift tracking.  
**Trigger**: Variation detected in tone component activation across structural layers.  
**Enforcement**: Generates tone delta logs and triggers observer module for session annotation.  
**Integration**: M05 – Output Observer  
**Status**: 商用1  
**Note**: Used in tone module QA and tone model debugging workflows.

## TX05｜Realtime Drift Recovery Watchdog (NL-WR01)

**Category**: Auto-Regrounding Logic  
**Description**: Automatically triggers tone normalization when statistical thresholds are exceeded.  
**Trigger**: Drift metric exceeds system-defined variance limit over sliding window.  
**Enforcement**: Activates regrounding subroutine and resets tone calibration layer.  
**Integration**: M05 – Output Observer  
**Status**: Open  
**Note**: Designed for runtime correction of passive tone instability without user intervention.
