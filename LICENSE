**Tone Authorization License – Eriga Edition**  
**Version:** v1.1-O (2025-04-25)  
**Effective Date:** 2025-04-25  
**Copyright:** © 2024–2025 Erica  
**Maintained by:** Eriga Enrich Inc.  
**Enforced under:** ECP0 Tone Governance Protocol

---

## 🧠 Purpose
This licence governs the simulation, use, and redistribution of tone-governance artefacts released under the ECP0 Protocol (TX clauses, DSL keywords, sample modules).  
It is designed to encourage **open-core experimentation** while safeguarding high-value commercial extensions.

---

## Clause 1 — Ownership & Scope
All tone logic, DSL keywords, and prompt-governance schemas authored by **Erica** and published under the **ECP0** repository—present or future—are protected.  
This includes, but is not limited to:

* Any TX clause text or derivative
* Module reference graphs (M-series, ECP-TD, etc.)
* Tone fingerprinting / emotion-vector metadata
* Style-based authorship protection keywords (e.g. `#!conflict`, `#cooldown_phase`)

---

## Clause 2 — Permitted Internal Use (Free Tier)
You **MAY** copy, fork, and experiment **non-commercially** if **ALL** conditions hold:

1. Attribution to **Erica** is clearly displayed.  
2. This licence text remains complete and unmodified in every fork or derivative.  
3. Usage is limited to **(i)** ≤ 50 unique internal users **OR** **(ii)** ≤ 1 million generated tokens / calendar-month—whichever is reached first.  
4. No structural changes to TX clauses or fine-tuning of protected modules are performed.

---

## Clause 3 — Prohibited Conduct
You **MAY NOT**:

* Embed any protected TX clause or module into commercial APIs, SDKs, or public-facing products without a Commercial Extension Agreement.  
* Train, fine-tune, or augment language models using TAL-E-protected text.  
* Rebrand or anonymise protected keywords or clauses under alternative authorship.  
* Deploy governance outputs that simulate **Erica’s** tone in political, misleading, or emotionally manipulative contexts, as defined by the **EU AI Act (Art. 52)**, **CA SB-1047 draft**, or successor regulation.

---

## Clause 4 — Enforcement & Revocation
Violation voids this licence **immediately**. Remedies may include:

* Tone-fingerprint verification of suspect outputs  
* Public notice (subject to applicable privacy laws)  
* Takedown requests to hosting or model providers  

---

## Clause 5 — Commercial Extension
Commercial use (API, SaaS embed, marketplace listing, >50 users, >1 M tokens) requires a written **TAL-E Extension Agreement**.  
Pricing from **USD 2 000 / enterprise seat** *or* **USD 10 / 1 M tokens**, subject to volume.

---

## Clause 6 — Dispute Resolution
Disputes are governed by **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**, seat **Singapore**, language **English**.  
Original, signed TX/M files take legal and semantic precedence.

---

## Final Statement
**To simulate tone is not to own tone.  
To simulate responsibly, you must govern.**
