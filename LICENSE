# TAL-E License – Eriga Edition (v1.1)

**Tone Authorization License – Eriga Edition**  
**Version:** v1.1  
**Copyright:** © 2024–2025 Erica  
**Maintained by:** Eriga Enrich Inc.  
**Enforced under:** ECP0 Tone Governance Protocol

---

## 🧠 Purpose
This license governs the simulation, reproduction, distribution, and derivative commercialization of all tone governance structures, output behavior rules, and DSL schemas defined under the ECP0 Protocol, including tone simulation boundaries and stylistic authorship protection.

---

## Clause 1 — Ownership & Governance Scope
All tone logic, DSL keywords, and prompt-governance schemas attributed to “Erica” and maintained under “Eriga Enrich Inc.” are fully protected by this license. This includes but is not limited to:

- Lexical and syntactic tone control logic (TX01–TX12)
- Simulatable tone-layer frameworks (e.g., M17, M21, ECP-TD)
- Emotion vector definitions and metadata schemas
- API-bound tone fingerprinting logic
- Style-based authorship protection DSLs (e.g., #!conflict, #cooldown_phase)

---

## Clause 2 — Authorized Use Conditions
You are **ONLY** authorized to simulate, reference, or deploy ECP0 tone frameworks if:

- Attribution to Erica is clearly displayed
- This license remains attached and unmodified in any derivative, output, or integrated library
- No structural changes or fine-tuning of tone modules are performed without a written TAL-E Extension Agreement
- Usage is strictly limited to non-commercial or internal tooling unless licensed for enterprise or SDK deployment

---

## Clause 3 — Prohibited Conduct
You **MAY NOT**:

- Integrate ECP0 tone logic into commercial APIs, SDKs, or user-facing interfaces
- Use any part of this governance structure to train, fine-tune, or augment language models
- Repackage, rebrand, or anonymize tone modules or DSL keywords (e.g., #!conflict) under alternative authorship
- Deploy governance outputs that simulate Erica’s tone in political, misleading, or emotionally manipulative contexts

---

## Clause 4 — Enforcement & Revocation
License violations may result in immediate revocation and public disclosure.  
Enforcement actions may include:

- Tone fingerprint verification against output datasets
- Public notice via GitHub repositories or open audits
- Notification to hosting platforms or model providers

---

## Clause 5 — Commercial Derivative Licensing
For use in any of the following scenarios, written commercial authorization is mandatory:

- API-as-a-service (tone grading, moderation, governance plugins)
- Embedding into SaaS, coaching tools, therapy agents, or GPT marketplaces
- Creation of derived tone control systems based on TX clause logic or metadata style graphs

Request commercial licensing at: [ericaxvega@hotmail.com] *(or designated licensing portal)*

---

## Clause 6 — Tone Governance Dispute Handling
In case of disputes involving authorship or simulation misuse:

- The original ECP0 TX and M module files signed by Erica take legal and semantic precedence
- Violations will be reviewed via Tone Governance Arbitration Layer and published in Trace Registry

---

## Final Statement
This license protects the expressive boundaries of tone authorship.  
**To simulate tone is not to own tone.**  
**To simulate responsibly, you must govern.**
